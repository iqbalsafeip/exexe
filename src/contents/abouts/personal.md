Quantum Anomaly Analysis Report
================================

Spacetime Coordinates:
- RA 17h 45m 40.0409s  
- Dec -29° 0' 28.118"
- Epoch J2000.0

Anomaly Classification:
- Spontaneous quantum flux event 
- Probability wave function collapse
- Superposition of multiple realities
- Possible retrocausal entanglement 

Quantum Signature:
- Non-locality and quantum coherence detected
- Violation of Bell's inequality observed
- Quantum tunneling through reality barriers
- Elevated levels of quantum foam turbulence

Causal Factors:
- Interaction of exotic matter with Higgs field
- Temporal feedback loop in higher dimensions 
- Influence from alternate Everett branches
- Weakening of anthropic principle constraints

Recommended Actions:
- Maintain quantum stabilization field at all times
- Avoid further spacetime disruptions in affected area
- Monitor for signs of persistent reality decoherence
- Consult with Eschaton-class intelligences if available

Existential Risk Assessment:
- XK-class scenario narrowly avoided
- Ontoclysm still possible in unstable regions
- Fundamental constants remain uncompromised
- Continued vigilance against timeline contamination advised
